<h2>What To Consider Before Adopting A Pet </h2>

    <li>Verify in advance that you’re allowed to keep a pet where you live.</li>
    <li>Never adopt a pet on a whim or because you feel it’s love-at-first-sight</li>
    <li>Provide sufficient exercise and stimulation during the first few weeks</li>
    <li>Make any necessary modifications to your yard and fence, if you have one, to provide for your pet’s safety</li>
