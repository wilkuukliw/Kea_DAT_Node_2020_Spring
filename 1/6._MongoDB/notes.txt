MySQL(Relational Database example) vs. NoSQL

MySQL                       MongoDB
MariaDB                     DynamoDB
OracleDB                    Firebase
PostgreSQL                  Neo
msSQL                       Realm
CouchDB


// MongoDB

collections: furniture

[
    {
        "key": value
    },
    {   
        "price": 20.00
    }
]


// MongoDB usecases:


-when you re not sure about the schema yet   -- lead to rapis prototyping 
- type of companies: start-ups

Don't use:

- data is consistient or Relational
- data that is crucial, you have to be careful
- if you have set schema

More info:
    MongoDB you handle relations, data validation etc. in the application layer
    For relational database you can also do it in the application layer 
                    but the database is another safety net
